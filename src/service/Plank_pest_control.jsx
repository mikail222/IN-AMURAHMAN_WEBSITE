              <h3> plank pest control</h3> ....in buildings can be approached in
              several ways, depending on the type of pest and the area affected.
              Methods include improving sanitation and garbage control,
              modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators,
              traps, baits and pesticides.[59] For example, the pesticide Boron
              can be impregnated into the fibres of cellulose insulation to kill
              self-grooming insects such as ants and cockroaches.[60] Clothes
              moths can be controlled with airtight containers for storage,
              periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating and
              the use of chemicals. Traditional mothballs deter adult moths with
              strong-smelling naphthalene; modern ones use volatile repellents
              such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene. Moth larvae can be killed with
              insecticides such as permethrin or pyrethroids.[61] However,
              insecticides cannot safely be used in food storage areas;
              alternative treatments include freezing foods for four days at 0
              °F (−18 °C) or baking for half an hour at 130 °F (54 °C) to kill
              any insects present.[62] In

              also is reduction in the number of bacteria, viruses, or fungi to
              a desired concentration. Sterilization, or the complete
              elimination of all microorganisms, is generally not needed or in
              most cases not possible. The actual concentration of
              microorganisms required to cause a disease (or some other
              criteria) is not well-defined under most conditions, and
              disinfection procedures have developed primarily from an empirical
              basis. Disinfection may be needed for two distinctly different
              situations: (1) disinfection of nets, holding facilities, and
              piping prior to use; and (2) disinfection of process water prior
              to use or before reuse. In general, the first situation is much
              simpler as toxicity to culture organisms is not usually a problem.
              In the second case, the toxicity of the disinfection agent and its
              residues or derivatives to non-target organisms (i.e., culture
              organisms) is critical and will control the disinfection process.
              The effectiveness of a given disinfectant depends on the
              concentration of disinfectant, contact time, temperature,
              turbidity, particulate concentration, and specific microorganisms.
              Because the concentration of microorganisms varies widely,
              microorganism concentrations are typically expressed in what are
              called log units. If concentrations are expressed in #/ml, then
              the log concentration is equal to the base 10 logarithm of the
              actual concentration

              To minimise number of organisms in the population worldwide. The
              method of disinfection is used internationally for the safety of
              humans, to decrease the scale of transmission of diseases. A large
              emphasis of sterilisation and disinfection has been placed in the
              food industry, water sanitisation and medical care and hospitals.
              As these have found to be largest affected organisations with
              microorganisms and modes of transmission amongst the population.
              Different disinfectants are used in different industries, which
              target the specific flora.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disinfectants are classified by their chemical nature and each
              class has its unique characteristics, hazards, toxicities and
              efficacy against various microorganisms. Environmental conditions,
              such as the presence of organic matter, pH or water hardness can
              also impact the action of a disinfectant.
