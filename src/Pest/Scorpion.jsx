            <h3> Scorpions</h3> are predatory arachnids of the order Scorpiones.
            They have eight legs, and are easily recognized by a pair of
            grasping pincers and a narrow, segmented tail, often carried in a
            characteristic forward curve over the back and always ending with a
            stinger. The evolutionary history of scorpions goes back 435 million
            years. They mainly live in deserts but have adapted to a wide range
            of environmental conditions, and can be found on all continents
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> Scorpions </b>primarily prey on insects and other invertebrates,
            but some species hunt vertebrates. They use their pincers to
            restrain and kill prey, or to prevent their own predation. The
            venomous sting is used for offense and defense. During courtship,
            the male and female grasp each other's pincers and dance while he
            tries to move her onto his sperm packet. All known species give live
            birth and the female cares for the young as their exoskeletons
            harden, transporting them on her back. The exoskeleton contains
            fluorescent chemicals and glows under ultraviolet light.
          </p>
          <p>
            The vast majority of species do not seriously threaten humans, and
            healthy adults usually do not need medical treatment after a sting.
            About 25 species (fewer than one percent) have venom capable of
            killing a human, which happens frequently in the parts of the world
            where they live, primarily where access to medical treatment is
            unlikely.

              The "tail" or metasoma consists of five segments and the telson,
              which is not strictly a segment. The five segments are merely body
              rings; they lack apparent sterna or terga, and become larger
              distally. These segments have keels, setae and bristles which may
              be used for taxonomic classification. The anus is at the distal
              and ventral end of the last segment, and is encircled by four anal
              papillae and the anal arch.[58] The tails of some species contain
              light receptors.[45]

              Most scorpion species are nocturnal or crepuscular, finding
              shelter during the day in burrows, cracks in rocks and tree
              bark.[68] Many species dig a shelter underneath stones a few
              centimeters long. Some may use burrows made by other animals
              including spiders, reptiles and small mammals. Other species dig
              their own burrows which vary in complexity and depth. Hadrurus
              species dig burrows as over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) deep. Digging is done
              using the mouth parts, claws and legs. In several species,
              particularly of the family Buthidae, individuals may gather in the
              same shelter; bark scorpions may aggregate up to 30 individuals.
              In some species, families of females and young sometimes
              aggregate.[69] Scorpions prefer areas where the temperature
              remains in the range of 11–40 °C (52–104 °F), but may survive
              temperatures from well below freezing to desert heat.[70][71]
              Scorpions can withstand intense heat: Leiurus quinquestriatus,
              Scorpio maurus and Hadrurus arizonensis can live in temperatures
              of 45–50 °C (113–122 °F) if they are sufficiently hydrated. Desert
              species must deal with the extreme changes in temperature from day
              to night or between seasons; Pectinibuthus birulai lives in a
              temperature range of −30–50 °C (−22–122 °F). Scorpions that live
              outside deserts prefer lower temperatures. The ability to resist
              cold may be related to the increase in the sugar trehalose when
              the temperature drops.
