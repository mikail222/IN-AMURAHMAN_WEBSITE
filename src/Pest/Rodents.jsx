          <h2> Rodents</h2>
          <p>
            Rodents are small mammals. Interestingly, they are the largest group
            of mammals with over 2200 species and constitute almost half the
            population of mammal species.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a whole range of them from rats and mice, to Squirells, to
            porcupines and beavers, rats and mice being the most common in
            relation to their interaction with human habitats and therefore, are
            pests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rodents eat food from the farm, store houses, kitchen, gutters,
            dumpsters and even your clothing. They have short fast legs and
            therefore are not so easy to catch in a race which makes them more
            annoying.

          <h3>DISEASES CAUSED BY RODENTS </h3>
          <p>How They Spread Diseases</p>
          <p>
            One of the major problems with rodent infestation is the diseases
            they cause to humans. Rats don’t just break into your home, eat your
            food, build a family and leave droppings- they also happen to be
            very successful at spreading diseases through their droppings, urine
            as well as parasites on their bodies.
          </p>
          <p>Rodents transmit diseases in two ways: Directly and indirectly.</p>
          <p>
            Direct transmission happens when you accidentally touch infected
            urine or droppings of rodents. The most common diseases transmitted
            directly by Rodents are:
          </p>
          <li>
            1. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: A severe respiratory disease
            causing flu-like symptoms, dizziness, and stomach problems at first,
            then extreme shortness of breath.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Leptospirosis: A bacterial disease causing flu-like symptoms,
            plus jaundice and red eyes.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Plague; A disease causing rapid-onset fever, chills, and
            weakness, plus necrotic tissue swollen lymph nodes, or pneumonia,
            depending on the strain.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Rat-bite fever; A disease causing fever, vomiting, rash,
            headache, and body pain.
          </li>
          <li>5. Salmonellosis; A bacterial infection causing diarrhea.</li>
          <li>
            6. Tularemia; An illness causing fever and sometimes ulcers,
            inflammation, and chest pain. Indirect transmission happens when a
            rat’s parasite like Ticks also bite and infect humans.
          </li>
          <p>The diseases transmitted indirectly through Rodents include;</p>
          <p>
            Babesiosis. Lyme disease. West Nile disease. The Center for Disease
            Control and Prevention says Worldwide, Rodents are known to spread
            over 35 diseases to humans.
          </p>
          <h2>HOW DO RODENTS SPREAD THESE DISEASES?</h2>
          <p>
            Rodents pick up viruses the same way humans do- with their fingers
            and mouths.(Good thing we can wash our hands)
          </p>
          <p>
            All the time they hang out at the dumpster and gutters, they pick up
            germs and even eat them. Rodents are constantly urinating and
            defecating. When they enter your home, they don’t stop. They urinate
            in your pans and pots, on your table and other unexpected places.
            Without suspecting, you touch them, inhale and often times consume
            the urine and feces, getting those germs into your bodies. It’s very
            harmful to have Rodents around.

            Open your packet of cookies when you’re not ready to eat and make it
            softer than you like as a result of exposure and eventually, waste

          <li>
            1. Seal up holes: Seal up holes inside and outside your home to
            prevent entry by rodents. Pay special attention to Windows, doors,
            walls and even the roof.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            2. Clean Up: Clean up food and water sources in and near your house
            and ensure the garbage can is covered with a tight lid.
          </li>

            {" "}
            3. Build a Wall: Living in a fenceless house can be quite
            uncomfortable. Anything can just branch in at will, there is little
            privacy, especially with rodents. It’s easier for them to get into
            your unfenced building than a fenced house so they take on the
            opportunity and forget to thank you.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            4. Remove Outdoor Food Sources: Gardens and fruit trees can attract
            rodents. If you have fruit trees, remove all fruits that drop to the
            ground regularly. Keep the trees pruned to prevent hiding spots for
            rodents. Keep your garden free of rotting food and hiding places.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            5. The goodness of mint and predator urine: Plant deterrents in your
            garden or compound to scare rodents away. Mint plants are such great
            deterrents. Plant them around your company. Also, predator urine
            sprayed around the compound is a good deterrent of rodents. One of
            such predators is the fox. You can easily find this at a local
            garden store in liquid or powder form.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            6. Get a pretty pet: The scent of cats alone scare rodents. Get a
            cat as a pet.
