            Roaches are nocturnal creatures that is, they are most active at
            night and prefer to stay in cracks and crevices during the day.
            Cockroaches have a wide diet ranging from food, paper, dead insects,
            leaves to animal feces. They eat anything available with preference
            for sugar, fatty foods and decaying organic matter. Cockroaches are
            destructive creatures.

            They damage clothing and furniture and emits an offensive odor. They
            transmit many human diseases like Typhoid fever, food poisoning and
            Dysentry. World Health Organization describes Cockroaches as
            “Unhygienic scavengers in human settlements.” The cockroach
            lifecycle is composed of 3 developmental stages; the egg, nymph and
            adult stages. Cockroaches eggs grow in sac called ootheca which is
            attached to the female’s abdomen or in other species, inside the
            female’s body.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            The number of eggs in this sac ranges from 6-40 in number. After 6-8
            weeks, nymphs emerge from the ootheca. These nymphs undergo series
            of molting for a period of 1year to become adults. They eat from the
            trash and kitchen until they become adult cockroaches. Adult
            cockroaches live for 1-2 years{" "}

            do so through cracks, leaks and crevices in the doors, windows,
            walls and behind toilets. You can prevent them from getting in in

            become their favorite place if you don’t do this. Cover your pots
            and pans that contain food with the appropriate lids. Don’t leave a
            spoon sticking out of your covered pot. It’s only half covered that
            way! Avoid leaving dirty dishes in the sink overnight, Wash all. As
            you do that, make sure you’re not leaving that grain of rice in the

            food in the fridge, cover them well.

            up! Clean up crumbs of snacks your toddler got on the floor, clean
            your microwave and oven after use, take out the trash before it
            spills over. 5 Declutter: Removing clutter in your house will limit
            the number of places cockroaches can hide. Stacks of old newspapers
            and magazines, cartons of consumed beer and beverages, etc should be
            removed. As long as you keep a conducive place for cockroaches, they
