            Mosquitoes are major, disease causing, household pests of the class
            Insecta. They have a characteristic slender frame and long fragile
            legs. Their body is covered with scales and their antennas are
            feathery.

            <h3> LIFE CYCLE </h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Females lay eggs on water surfaces which hatch into larvae. These
            larvae move in wriggling movements and feed on algae, bacteria and
            organic matter found in water and as such, are called wrigglers. In
            the pupal stage, they are free swimming and don’t feed on anything-
            Mosquito larvae don’t eat at all. The length of the life cycle of
            mosquitoes vary from species to species.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>HOW MOSQUITOES FEED THEMSELVES</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Adult of both sexes live on land and feed on nectar from flowering
            plants. Females of most species enjoy a little more ‘luxury’ as they
            also feed on blood to perform their reproductive function. They feed
            on blood of humans, birds, rodents and snakes. Mosquitoes are quite
            beneficial in the ecosystem as they act as major pollinating agents
            through their feeding interaction with flowering plants. They brush
            against flowers sexual organs and pick up or transfer pollen grains.
            With millions of mosquitoes around, plants are able to spread and
            multiply. Almost 80% of the food crops we eat require pollination.
            So, typically, if we don’t have mosquitoes, we wouldn’t have enough
            food. But…. Hold up

          <p>
            Before you get carried away by this benefit, remember they’re rude,
            annoying, disturbing and cause diseases. They cause diseases by
            transferring pathogens to you when they feed on your blood. Some of
            these diseases, like malaria have been around and causing deaths for
            years, others like zika virus and Chikungunya emerged only recently.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            The most prominent mosquito-borne diseases are transmitted by 3
            genera of mosquitoes- The Anopheles, Culex and Aedes Mosquitoes.
          </p>{" "}
          <b>Anopheles Mosquito:</b>{" "}
          <p>
            They are the only known carriers of malaria. They also transmit
            filariasis and encephalitis. Female Anopheles mosquitoes are popular
            because they transmit the ancient Malaria. The fear of malaria has
            greatly reduced because treatment is now available. It’s over 50
            years since Anti-malarial drugs we’re discovered. Yet, there are
            over a million deaths from malaria every year. With that statistics,
            the deaths before malaria treatment was found is unimaginable.
          </p>{" "}
          <b>Culex Mosquito:</b>{" "}
          <p>
            They are also known as common house mosquitoes. They are the main
            vectors of diseases like West Nile Fever, viral encephalitis and
            filariasis as well as viral diseases of birds and horses. They feed
            at night and are found indoors and outdoors. Aedes Mosquitoes: They
            can be identified by the black and white markings on their bodies
            and legs. Unlike most mosquitoes, they are active and bite during
            the day time. They carry microorganisms that cause yellow fever,
            dengue, zika fever and encephalitis and as such are called Yellow
            Fever Mosquitoes

          <h3> ARE MOSQUITOES ATTRACTED TO SOME PEOPLE MORE THAN OTHERS?</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            The answer is… Yes! It might seem that you have been getting special
            attention from mosquitoes more than others in your house. Well…
            First, you’re not crazy. There are factors responsible for that. To
            prevent and avoid selective attention by mosquitoes, you have to
            understand what draws them to you.

            <b>1. Dark Clothing:</b> Mosquitoes are attracted to dark clothing
            like black, red, green, especially black. It’s easier for them to
            see such colors than light ones.
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            <b>2. Blood type:</b> Your blood type can attract mosquitoes.
            Studies show that mosquitoes are attracted to certain blood types
            than others.
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            <b>3. Gas:</b> You’ve always been warned about your heavy breathing
            pattern, especially when you’re asleep. You probably don’t care
            because well…, it’s not your fault and it doesn’t affect you
            directly, so you think. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon-dioxide
            from both humans are plants. If you breath heavily, you exhale more
            carbon dioxide than others, that makes you the chosen one.

            <b> 4. Fragrance:</b> When you decide to smell like the flowers in
            the tropics, you wouldn’t only attract your crush, but the
            mosquitoes as well. Your soap, cream or body spray could be what’s
            putting you in trouble. The sweet smell from flowers is what
            attracts them to flowers in the first place. So, if you smell like
            that, you’ll be visited like that.

            <b>5. Heat:</b> if you’re hot, like a heater, thick thighs, men will
            turn, and lick their lips. That perfect, clean beards, 6 packs and
            strong arms can make the ladies. In the case of mosquitoes, they’re
            attracted to the actual heat. That is, warm temperatures and warm
            bodies. They’re drawn to you if your body temperature is high. Your
            sweat is also attractive to mosquitoes. They’re drawn to high
            humidity and so, love your sweat.

            6.
            <b> What you eat:</b> The chemical composition in your body is also
            sensed by mosquitoes. High quantity of lactic acid, acetone and
            potassium entice mosquitoes. Eating foods high in potassium like
            bananas, coconut water and dried fruit make you a victim. Also,
            you’ve been hearing since forever that your drinking habit will be
            your down fall. Well I don’t know about that, but what’s certain is
            they’re attracted to beer. A survey was carried out to prove this;
            people were asked to drink 1 litre of beer while others drank 1
            litre of water. At the end of the day, mosquitoes hung around those
            that drank beer more than those that drank water.

            7.<b>Pregnancy:</b> Studies show that expectant mothers are more
            attractive to mosquitoes than they are when they’re not pregnant.
            Factors like their heavy breathing, sweat and gases they emit are
            responsible for such.

            Beetles are the most vast insects in the world and are found in
            almost all climates and latitudes. Almost half of all insect species
            are beetle. There are about 400 000 known beetle species around the
            world although they’ve not been found in the sea or polar regions.

          <p>
            Of all insects, beetles are the biggest, boldest and in some
            opinions, the most beautiful. They are known for having a
            particularly hard exoskeleton and a hard wing case called the elytra
            which serves as a protective cover for the second pair of wings
            (main pair) and the hind part of the body.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            In some species of beetles, the wings are present, but they don’t
            fly, e.g., ground beetle and stout beetle, while in some, both wings
            and flying ability is absent e.g., Glow worms They feed on plants
            and fungi, decaying organic matter and other invertebrates such as
            earthworms and snails based on the species of beetle.

            Beetles lay their eggs in clumps. These eggs are tiny and ranges
            from several dozens to several thousands. The larvae of beetles are
            called grubs and are typically the main feeding stage of beetles.
            They feed voraciously and can stay as long as several years before
            transitioning into the pupal stage. Adults also have a variable
            lifespan of weeks to years depending on the species.
